### Project Instructions
#### Software

Use this README.md to describe your project files, code files, AI models etc.
It is very helpful for anyone using your project as basis for other projects to know which piece of code does what. 
It's also good practice to structurize the folders in an organized manner. You can also add links or files for necessary dependencies here.

It would be very nice to have an environment setup script if you have the time to create one!
